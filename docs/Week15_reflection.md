## Personal Enhancement Progress
My personal enhancement is the personalized pollen dashboard you saw in the demo above. I created it because I struggle with severe allergies and wanted to solve a real-world problem that directly affects me. By combining historical data with real-time pollen information (using Google's Pollen API), this tool helps me stay better prepared throughout allergy seasonâ€”which, for me, lasts nearly all year due to sensitivities to tree, grass, and weed pollen. In fact, I built my entire capstone project around this enhancement, rather than treating it as an afterthought.

## Status Update (Text Entry)
All in all, I've completed the weather logger, integrated matplotlib visualizations, a theme switcher, personalized health reccomendations, and my personal enhancement is finished. I plan on adding some prediction logic this week using ARIMA and if I get to it, adding some more chart functionality. We'll see if I can make it happen. T-minus two weeks!
