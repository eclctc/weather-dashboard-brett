## Feature functionality explanation
This feature intoroduces an easy to use toggle between dark and light modes for my app. It has custom methods, labels and controls that constantly monitor the state of the theme being used with the app. This creates a low code, easy to maintain user experience as the theme updates in real time. While this feature isn't one of the primary features I want to focus on. It is something that I plan on implementing. Now that I have the data set that I want to use, I'm gearing up to rebuild the app from the foundation up. Lot's of coffee and some can do attitude is in my future.

## Blockers
The only real blocker I've had was acquiring my dataset. Now that is out of the way, I'm sure a whole new set of roadblocks and impediments will show up. Luckily, I'm getting much better at solving problems. Also, now that I have a project schedule, a UI sketch, and most of my functionality mapped out. I'm excited to see where this goes over the next few weeks!
